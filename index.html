                        <p>With threat of cross-voting looming large, political parties in Maharashtra have moved their MLAs to hotels and are holding last minute strategy meetings ahead of Friday’s biennial elections to 11 Legislative Council seats for which 12 candidates are in the fray.
                        Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), who form the electoral college for the polls, will gather in Vidhan Bhavan complex in south Mumbai where voting will take place from 9am to 4pm. Counting of votes will be taken up at 5pm.
                        Eleven members of the upper house of the state legislature are retiring on July 27 and these high-stakes polls are being held to fill the vacancies.To keep their MLAs together, political parties are organising dinner meetings and arranging hotel stays for them ahead of the council elections, which are taking place just three months ahead of the assembly polls in the state.
                        Leader of Opposition in the assembly Vijay Wadettiwar of the Congress, a constituent of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), has organized a dinner meeting for his party MLAs at a city hotel on Thursday night.The Congress has issued a whip to its MLAs asking them to vote as per the party directive.</p>

                        <p>Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy is changing the state's governance style and developing a new political strategy with far-reaching effects. Since assuming office in December 2023, as the state’s second CM, Reddy has demonstrated an impressive ability to adjust and innovate in policy and politics.It’s showcased by his approach to political defections. Reddy's approach involves countering the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) by engineering defections from their party.The Politics of Defection 
                        Reddy has successfully convinced six BRS MLAs to defect to the Congress. He claims about 20 more are in touch and ready to switch allegiances soon. This wave of defections aims to consolidate his power and strengthen the Congress’s position in Telangana.
                        Among the prominent defectors is Rajya Sabha MP K Kesava Rao, who recently joined the Congress. Reddy's statement that the BRS will soon be reduced to KCR and his family members highlights his strategic intent to weaken his main political rival significantly.</p>

                        <p>Germany has closed a deal with telecom providers to exclude Chinese companies such as Huawei or ZTE from the nation's 5G network products from 2029, its interior minister said on Thursday.
                        "We have now reached a clear and strict agreement with the telecoms companies," minister Nancy Faeser told reporters in Berlin, hailing the deal as a crucial safeguard for digital security in Europe's largest economy.           The agreement follows talks between the interior ministry and Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland, and aims to shield Germany's critical infrastructure from China, whose influence is seen as a potential security risk.
                        Faeser said Berlin had informed Beijing about the agreement and that she did not expect any retaliation over the planned curbs to Chinese technology.</p>

                        <p>Apple Inc. has avoided the threat of fines from European Union regulators by agreeing to open up its mobile wallet technology to other providers free of charge for a decade.The settlement brings to an end an investigation into the US tech giant’s closely guarded payments technology. The EU earlier warned that restricting access to the technology amounted to an abuse of its market power.“Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the ‘tap and go’ technology of iPhones,” the EU’s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said. The decision will prevent Apple “from excluding other mobile wallets from the iPhone’s ecosystem.”Under the EU settlement, consumers in Europe will be able to use alternative digital wallets to pay for goods and services at checkouts. The commitments remain binding for 10 years and Apple risks a fine of as much as 10% of global annual revenue if it violates the agreement.The closing of the investigation marks a brief respite between the EU and Apple, which have long been at loggerheads over how the Cupertino, California-based firm toes the regulatory line in Brussels.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed as “historical accomplishment” Indian women shuttlers winning the Badminton Asia Team Championships, and said the way our ‘nari shakti’ (women power) has been excelling in various sports is phenomenal.
            Anmol Kharb yet again performed when it mattered, winning the decisive fifth rubber to lead the Indian women to a historic Badminton Asia Team Championships title with a tight 3-2 victory over a depleted Thailand, in Malaysia’s Shah Alan on Sunday. 
            The young sprightly group of Indian women’s team, led by seasoned PV Sindhu, defied all expectations to come up trumps against two-time bronze medallists Thailand.
            In a post on X, Modi said, “A historical accomplishment! Congratulations to the incredible Indian team who have, for the first time ever, won the Women’s Team Trophy at the Badminton Asia Championships. Their success will motivate several upcoming athletes.” “The way our Nari Shakti has been excelling in various sports is just phenomenal,” he said.

                <p>The Supreme Court on July 12 granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the money laundering case initiated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in relation to the now-scrapped Delhi Excise policy. 
                    A Bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta however observed that certain legal questions arising out of Mr. Kejriwal’s plea challenging his arrest by the central agency need to be referred to a larger Bench.          
                    However, the Chief Minister will continue to remain in Tihar jail as he has been separately arrested by the Central Bureau Of Investigation (CBI) in a corruption case related to the alleged scam.

                <p>Sarfira movie review: Inspirational stories of grit and determination have been a favourite trope for our filmmakers, more so when they're inspired by true events or based on someone's life. They instantly strike an emotional chord. Akshay Kumar's Sarfira is a testament to the fact that when you have a good story at hand, even if it's a remake, there's a lot you can do to present it to a different set of audience in a whole new setting.Directed by Sudha Kongara, who also helmed the Tamil original Soorarai Pottru (2020) starring Suriya, Sarfira, an adaptation of GR Gopinath's memoir Simply Fly: A Deccan Odyssey, is beyond just being a rags-to-riches story. It talks about resilience, and how when one decides to stand against the system and fight all odds, there's no stopping them. Though there have been way too many films on people chasing unachievable dreams, Sarfira stands out in its treatment and execution, and definitely for the consistency in its script. There's just right amount of every emotion it plays with and it doesn't get stuck in it for long. You experience happiness and sadness, and the next moment, there's a sense of pride in seeing the events unfold in the manner they do.</p>

                <p>Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has directed all government agencies to prioritise search and rescue efforts.

The landslide swept the buses at around 3:30 am. We are at the incident site and a search operation is underway. Incessant rain is hampering our efforts to search for the missing buses," Yadav confirmed to ANI.Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ directed all government agencies to search and rescue the passengers.</p>

                <p>With no formal coaching experience—Gautam Gambhir has only worked as a mentor with two IPL franchises—and a professional retirement as late as 2019, how did Gambhir become BCCI's choice as India's new head coach? The popular notion is that his role in helping Kolkata Knight Riders win the IPL after a decade-long wait did the trick. The KKR players and the support staff were vocal about Gambhir's role in creating the perfect team environment. True, but that hardly mattered to the BCCI.</p>

                <p>A renewed thrust on jobs, alongside a concerted push to manufacturing and rural businesses, were the key issues flagged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a meeting with economists on Thursday.
                    With less than a fortnight for the presentation of the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23, the Prime Minister is learnt to have also touched upon the complexities of Centre-state relations, particularly with the Centre funding many programmes or schemes, and states not assuming full accountability over implementing these on the ground.          
                    The meeting was held in the NITI Aayog office with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Principal Secretary P K Mishra also present.</p>
